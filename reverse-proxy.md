# Reverse Proxy Documentation

A [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) is basically a web server that enables computers on the internet to access a service in a [private subnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network).

**Please note:** Publishing the AIO interface with a valid certificate to the public internet is **not** the goal of this documentation! Instead, the main goal is to publish Nextcloud with a valid certificate to the public internet which is **not** running inside the mastercontainer but in a different container! If you need a valid certificate for the AIO interface, see [point 5](#5-optional-get-a-valid-certificate-for-the-aio-interface).

In order to run Nextcloud behind a web server or reverse proxy (like Apache, Nginx and else), you need to specify the port that AIO's Apache container shall use, add a specific config to your web server or reverse proxy and modify the startup command a bit. All examples below will use port `11000` as example Apache port which will be exposed on the host. Modify the port to your needings.

**Attention:** The process to run Nextcloud behind a reverse proxy consists of at least steps 1, 2 and 4:
1. **Configure the reverse proxy! See [point 1](#1-add-this-to-your-reverse-proxy-config)**
1. **Use the in this document provided startup command! See [point 2](#2-use-this-startup-command)**
1. Optional: If the reverse proxy is installed on the same host and in the host network, you should limit the apache container to only listen on localhost. See [point 3](#3-limit-the-access-to-the-apache-container)
1. **Open the AIO interface. See [point 4](#4-open-the-aio-interface)**
1. Optional: Get a valid certificate for the AIO interface! See [point 5](#5-optional-get-a-valid-certificate-for-the-aio-interface)
1. Optional: How to debug things? See [point 6](#6-how-to-debug-things)

## 1. Add this to your reverse proxy config

**Please note:** Since the Apache container gets created by the mastercontainer, there is **NO** way to provide custom docker labels or custom environmental variables for the Apache container. So please do not attempt to do this because you will fail! Only the documented way will work!

### Apache

<details>

<summary>click here to expand</summary>

**Disclaimer:** It might be possible that the config below is not working 100% correctly, yet. Improvements to it are very welcome!

Add this as a new Apache site config:

(The config below assumse that you are using certbot to get your certificates. You need to create them first in order to make it work.)

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName <your-nc-domain>

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
    RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
    RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =<your-nc-domain>
    RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,NE,R=permanent]
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName <your-nc-domain>

    # Reverse proxy based on https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy_wstunnel.html
    RewriteEngine On
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode
    
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:11000/ nocanon
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:11000/
    
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
    RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} "^[a-zA-Z]+ /(.*) HTTP/\d+(\.\d+)?$"
    RewriteRule .? "ws://localhost:11000/%1" [P,L]

    # Enable h2, h2c and http1.1
    Protocols h2 h2c http/1.1
    
    # Solves slow upload speeds caused by http2
    H2WindowSize 5242880

    # SSL
    SSLEngine on
    Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-nc-domain>/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-nc-domain>/privkey.pem

    # Disable HTTP TRACE method.
    TraceEnable off
    <Files ".ht*">
        Require all denied
    </Files>

    # Support big file uploads
    LimitRequestBody 0
</VirtualHost>
```

Of course you need to modify `<your-nc-domain>` to the domain on which you want to run Nextcloud. Also make sure to adjust the port 11000 to match the chosen APACHE_PORT. **Please note:** The above configuration will only work if your reverse proxy is running directly on the host that is running the docker daemon. If the reverse proxy is running in a docker container, you can use the `--network host` option (or `network_mode: host` for docker-compose) when starting the reverse proxy container in order to connect the reverse proxy container to the host network. If that is not an option for you, you can alternatively instead of `localhost` use the ip-address that is displayed after running the following command on the host OS: `ip a | grep "scope global" | head -1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's|/.*||'` (the command only works on Linux)

To make the config work you can run the following command:
`sudo a2enmod rewrite proxy proxy_http proxy_wstunnel ssl headers http2`

</details>

### Caddy (Recommended)

<details>

<summary>click here to expand</summary>

Add this to your Caddyfile:

```
https://<your-nc-domain>:443 {
    reverse_proxy localhost:11000
}
```

Of course you need to modify `<your-nc-domain>` to the domain on which you want to run Nextcloud. Also make sure to adjust the port 11000 to match the chosen APACHE_PORT. **Please note:** The above configuration will only work if your reverse proxy is running directly on the host that is running the docker daemon. If the reverse proxy is running in a docker container, you can use the `--network host` option (or `network_mode: host` for docker-compose) when starting the reverse proxy container in order to connect the reverse proxy container to the host network. If that is not an option for you, you can alternatively instead of `localhost` use the ip-address that is displayed after running the following command on the host OS: `ip a | grep "scope global" | head -1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's|/.*||'` (the command only works on Linux)

**Advice:** You may have a look at [this](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/575#discussion-4055615) for a more complete example.

### Caddy with ACME DNS-challenge

<details>

<summary>click here to expand</summary>

You can get AIO running using the ACME DNS-challenge. Here is how to do it.

1. Follow [this documentation](https://caddy.community/t/how-to-use-dns-provider-modules-in-caddy-2/8148) in order to get a Caddy build that is compatible with your domain provider's DNS challenge.
1. Add this to your Caddyfile:
    ```
    https://<your-nc-domain>:443 {
        reverse_proxy localhost:11000
        tls {
            dns <provider> <key>
        }
    }
    ```
   Of course you need to modify `<your-nc-domain>` to the domain on which you want to run Nextcloud. You also need to adjust `<provider>` and `<key>` to match your case. Also make sure to adjust the port 11000 to match the chosen APACHE_PORT. **Please note:** The above configuration will only work if your reverse proxy is running directly on the host that is running the docker daemon. If the reverse proxy is running in a docker container, you can use the `--network host` option (or `network_mode: host` for docker-compose) when starting the reverse proxy container in order to connect the reverse proxy container to the host network. If that is not an option for you, you can alternatively instead of `localhost` use the ip-address that is displayed after running the following command on the host OS: `ip a | grep "scope global" | head -1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's|/.*||'` (the command only works on Linux)
1. Now continue with [point 2](#2-use-this-startup-command) but additionally, add `-e SKIP_DOMAIN_VALIDATION=true` to the docker run command which will disable the dommain validation (because it is known that the domain validation will not when using the DNS-challenge since no port is publicly opened.

**Advice:** In order to make it work in your home network, you may add the internal ipv4-address of your reverse proxy as A DNS-record to your domain and disable the dns-rebind-protection in your router. Another way it to set up a local dns-server like a pi-hole and set up a custom dns-record for that domain that points to the internal ip-adddress of your reverse proxy (see https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-can-i-access-nextcloud-locally). If both is not possible, you may add the domain to the hosts file which is needed then for any devices that shall use the server.

</details>

### Cloudflare Tunnel

<details>

<summary>click here to expand</summary>

Although it does not seems like it is the case but from AIO perspective a Cloudflare Tunnel works like a reverse proxy. Here is how to make it work:

1. Install the Cloudflare Tunnel on the same machine where AIO will be running on and point the Tunnel with the domain that you want to use for AIO to `http://localhost:11000`. If the Tunnel is running on a different machine, you can alternatively instead of `localhost` use the ip-address that is displayed after running the following command on the host OS: `ip a | grep "scope global" | head -1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's|/.*||'` (the command only works on Linux)
1. Now continue with [point 2](#2-use-this-startup-command) but additionally, add `-e SKIP_DOMAIN_VALIDATION=true` to the docker run command which will disable the dommain validation (because it is known that the domain validation will not work behind a Cloudflare Tunnel). So you need to ensure yourself that you've configured everything correctly.

**Advice:** Make sure to [disable Cloudflares Rocket Loader feature](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/login-page-not-working-solved/149417/8) as otherwise Nextcloud's login prompt will not be shown.

### HaProxy

### Nginx-Proxy

<details>

<summary>click here to expand</summary>

Unfortunately it is not possible to configure nginx-proxy in a way that works because it completely relies on environmental variables of the docker containers itself. Providing these variables does not work as stated above.

If you really want to use AIO, we recommend you to switch to caddy. It is simply amazing!<br>
Of course understandable if that is not possible for you.

Apart from that, there is this: [manual-install](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/manual-install)

Of course you need to modify `<your-nc-domain>` to the domain on which you want to run Nextcloud. Also change `<you>@<your-mail-provider-domain>` to a mail address of yours. Also make sure to adjust the port 11000 to match the chosen APACHE_PORT. **Please note:** The above configuration will only work if your reverse proxy is running directly on the host that is running the docker daemon. If the reverse proxy is running in a docker container, you can use the `--network host` option (or `network_mode: host` for docker-compose) when starting the reverse proxy container in order to connect the reverse proxy container to the host network.

### Traefik 2

<details>

<summary>click here to expand</summary>

**Disclaimer:** It might be possible that the config below is not working 100% correctly, yet. Improvements to it are very welcome!

Traefik's building blocks (router, service, middlewares) need to be defined using dynamic configuration similar to [this](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/file/#configuration-examples) official Traefik configuration example. Using **docker labels _won't work_** because of the nature of the project.

The examples below define the dynamic configuration in YAML files. If you rather prefer TOML, use a YAML to TOML converter.

1. In Traefik's static configuration define a [file provider](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/file/) for dynamic providers:

    ```yml
    # STATIC CONFIGURATION
   
    entryPoints:
        https:
            address: ":443" # Create an entrypoint called "https" that uses port 443
    
    certificatesResolvers:
        # Define "letsencrypt" certificate resolver
        letsencrypt:
            acme:
                storage: /letsencrypt/acme.json # Defines the path where certificates should be stored
                email: <your-email-address> # Where LE sends notification about certificates expiring
                tlschallenge: true
   
    providers:
        file:
            directory: "/path/to/dynamic/conf" # Adjust the path according your needs.
            watch: true
    ```

1. Declare the router, service and middlewares for Nextcloud in `/path/to/dynamic/conf/nextcloud.yml`:

    ```yml
    http:
        routers:
            nextcloud:
                rule: "Host(<your-nextcloud-domain>)"
                entrypoints:
                    - "https"
                service: nextcloud
                middlewares:
                    - nextcloud-chain
                tls:
                    certresolver: "letsencrypt"

        services:
            nextcloud:
                loadBalancer:
                    servers:
                        - url: "http://localhost:11000" # Use the host's IP address if Traefik runs outside the host network

        middlewares:
            nextcloud-secure-headers:
                headers:
                    hostsProxyHeaders:
                        - "X-Forwarded-Host"
                    referrerPolicy: "same-origin"

            https-redirect:
                redirectscheme:
                    scheme: https 
   
            nextcloud-chain:
                chain:
                    middlewares:
                        # - ... (e.g. rate limiting middleware)
                        - https-redirect
                        - nextcloud-secure-headers
    ```

Of course you need to modify `<your-nextcloud-domain>` in the `nextcloud.yml` to the domain on which you want to run Nextcloud. Also make sure to adjust the port `11000` to match the chosen `APACHE_PORT`. 
    
**Please note:** The above configuration will only work if your reverse proxy is running directly on the host that is running the docker daemon. If the reverse proxy is running in a docker container, you can use the `--network host` option (or `network_mode: host` for docker-compose) when starting the reverse proxy container in order to connect the reverse proxy container to the host network. If that is not an option for you, you can alternatively instead of `localhost` use the ip-address that is displayed after running the following command on the host OS: `ip a | grep "scope global" | head -1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's|/.*||'` (the command only works on Linux)

## 2. Use this startup command

After adjusting your reverse proxy config, use the following command to start AIO:<br>

(For an docker-compose example, see the example further [below](#inspiration-for-a-docker-compose-file).)

```
# For Linux:
sudo docker run \
--sig-proxy=false \
--name nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer \
--restart always \
--publish 8080:8080 \
-e APACHE_PORT=11000 \
-e APACHE_IP_BINDING=0.0.0.0 \
--volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config \
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
nextcloud/all-in-one:latest
```

Note: You may be interested in adjusting Nextcloud’s datadir to store the files in a different location than the default docker volume. See [this documentation](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-change-the-default-location-of-nextclouds-datadir) on how to do it.

You should also think about limiting the apache container to listen only on localhost in case the reverse proxy is running on the same host and in the host network, by providing an additional environmental variable to this docker run command. See [point 3](#3-limit-the-access-to-the-apache-container).

On macOS see https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-run-aio-on-macos.

### Inspiration for a docker-compose file

Simply translate the docker run command into a docker-compose file. You can have a look at [this file](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) for some inspiration but you will need to modify it either way. You can find further examples here: https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/588

## 3. Limit the access to the apache container

Use this envorinmental variable during the initial startup of the mastercontainer to make the apache container only listen on localhost: `-e APACHE_IP_BINDING=127.0.0.1`. **Attention:** This is only recommended to be set if you use `localhost` in your reverse proxy config to connect to your AIO instance. If you use an ip-address instead of localhost, you should set it to `0.0.0.0`.

## 4. Open the AIO interface.
After starting AIO, you should be able to access the AIO Interface via `https://ip.address.of.the.host:8080`. Enter your domain that you've entered in the reverse proxy config and you should be done. Please do not forget to open port `3478/TCP` and `3478/UDP` in your firewall/router for the Talk container!

## 5. Optional: get a valid certificate for the AIO interface

If you want to also access your AIO interface publicly with a valid certificate, you can add e.g. the following config to your Caddyfile:

```
https://<your-nc-domain>:8443 {
    reverse_proxy https://localhost:8080 {
        transport http {
            tls_insecure_skip_verify
        }
    }
}
```

Of course you need to modify `<your-nc-domain>` to the domain on which you want to run Nextcloud. **Please note:** The above configuration will only work if your reverse proxy is running directly on the host that is running the docker daemon. If the reverse proxy is running in a docker container, you can use the `--network host` when starting the reverse proxy container in order to connect the reverse proxy container to the host network. If that is not an option for you, you can alternatively instead of `localhost` use the ip-address that is displayed after running the following command on the host OS: `ip a | grep "scope global" | head -1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's|/.*||'` (the command only works on Linux)

Afterwards should the AIO interface be accessible via `https://ip.address.of.the.host:8443`. You can alternatively change the domain to a different subdomain by using `https://<your-alternative-domain>:443` instead of `https://<your-nc-domain>:8443` in the Caddyfile and use that to access the AIO interface.

## 6. How to debug things?
If something does not work, follow the steps below:
1. Make sure to exactly follow the whole reverse proxy documentation step-for-step from top to bottom!
1. Make sure that the reverse proxy is running on the host OS or if running in a container, connected to the host network. If that is not possible, substitute `localhost` in the default configurations by the ip-address that you can easily get when running the following command on the host OS: `ip a | grep "scope global" | head -1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's|/.*||'` (The command only works on Linux)
1. Make sure that all ports match the chosen APACHE_PORT.
1. Make sure that the mastercontainer is able to spawn other containers. You can do so by checking that the mastercontainer indeed has access to the Docker socket which might not be positioned in one of the suggested directories like `/var/run/docker.sock` but in a different directory, based on your OS and the way how you installed Docker. The mastercontainer logs should help figuring this out. You can have a look at them by running `sudo docker logs nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer` after the container is started the first time.
1. Check if after the mastercontainer was started, the reverse proxy if running inside a container, can reach the provided apache port. You can test this by running `nc -z localhost 11000; echo $?` from inside the reverse proxy container. If the output is `0`, everything works. Alternatively you can of course use instead of `localhost` the ip-address of the host here for the test.
1. Try to configure everything from scratch if it still does not work!
1. As last resort, you may disable the domain validation by adding `-e SKIP_DOMAIN_VALIDATION=true` to the docker run command. But only use this if you are completely sure that you've correctly configured everything!
